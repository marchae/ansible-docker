### Description
Ansible playbook for building docker images

### Why
While docker containers is useful for various tasks process of their creation
leaves something to be desired:

1. RUN instructions in Dockerfile limited to simple commands
2. Poor reusability. You can't reuse RUN command from another Dockerfile
without inheriting from it or copying it
3. What if you want recreate docker image on bare metal, VM or some other
container runtime?

To solve this problems we could use existing provisioning tools such as Ansible
to build docker images.

### How
1. Install Ansible. Version 2.0 required to use new docker connection driver
2. Modify Dockerfile for your needs: select another base images, add additional
packages required by used Ansible modules
3. In playbook site.yml change image name and container name
4. Add new Ansible roles/tasks if needed

Run
```
ansible-playbook --module-path=ansible/modules/docker ansible/site.yml
```
after that you should have image with expected name. Tag and push it if needed.

### Under the hood
You maybe wondering why not just install ansible in container, mount playbook 
directory and run it like that
```
ansible-playbook foo.yml
```

There is some cons of this approach:

1. You have to install ansible inside container
2. You lose all benefits of docker filesystem caching: every time you run Ansible
it have to execute all tasks in playbook from the beginning

Approach used in this playbook is a little different.

On start we create named image from some Dockerfile and start named container
from this images. After container started we connect to it as if it was usual host.
Except instead of SSH we use docker connection driver. This way we don't have to
install ssh server in container. Then we run Ansible role and tasks on container
and after that we stop it. 

To use docker caching mechanism we use additional callback plugin. Every time
Ansible task succesfuly changes state of running container we commit it with
unique tag. Since Ansible tasks should be idemponent new images would be created
only when something changed.
